# Introduction
Clinical gait analysis is usually done with expensive motion capture systems but deep learning technologies can cut down the analysis cost.

Gait analysis was performed using Openpose (Z. Cao et al. 2019)

Alphapose (alphapose, 2022) and Mediapipe (mediapipe, 2020) by google are also used for pose estimations.

# Algorithms
Algorithms are classified into top down and bottom down approaches.

# Methodology
This is the methodology of this paper taken from (reference 2023).

# Results
This is the results section.

# Conclusion
These are the conclusions section.
