# Introduction
Clinical gait analysis is usually done with expensive motion capture systems but deep learning technologies can cut down the analysis cost.

Gait analysis was performed using Openpose (Z. Cao et al. 2019)

Alphapose (alphapose, 2022) and Mediapipe (mediapipe, 2020) by google are also used for pose estimations.
